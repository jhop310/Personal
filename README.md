# Personal
Colleagues and Friends,

I want to provide a brief summary here for those of you who may or may not engage with me indirectly at work.  While my organization and direct colleagues have been notified, this page is a catchall for anyone who may have been missed, or otherwise interacts with me less frequently.

I am a transgender woman and over the past few years have been slowly transitioning with the support of my family and friends.  While this matter is quite personal, it is important to me to be able to live authentically, including my interactions with you. If you have questions or would like to learn more about transgender people I recommend starting here: https://transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people

Going forward I ask that you please call me by my new name, Jen, and use she/her pronouns when referring to or talking about me.  
 
Iâ€™m very grateful to live in a state of where law includes gender identity as a protected class and allows me to make the choices that best support my happiness and future.  I'd also like to express my gratitude to the corporate HR team and my direct leadership in their support during this time period.
